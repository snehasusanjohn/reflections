hen you initialize a repository , a .git init files is created . We should do this because otherwise we cannot do version control with out this first step
A staging area is a placeholder for files before committing them into the repository . It helps to ensure that the files that you want commit into version control are really those ones
Do a git diff to find difference between the working directory and the staging area.
Branches help when you would want to incorporate new feature only for a particular case scenario . Another area where branches could be useful is when you have several developers working on the same files . So each developer would have a branch 
THe diagrams helps you visualize the branch structure and understanc reachability
We merge two branches when you want the changes of one branch to be included in the other bracnh .Representing it in diagram help for better understanding
automatic merging saves a lot of time when merging files without any conflicts . However for files wtih changes on the same lines ,manual merging is necessary
