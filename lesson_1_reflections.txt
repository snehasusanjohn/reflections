Diff between two files helps you spot the bug quite easily because you have lesser text to compare
Makes bug fixing much easier
pros: manual commits allow user to commit after every logical change , making it more meaningful
cons: if user forget to commit, then there is a disdvantage
A logical change would usually involve changing more than one file and it is useful for tracking purposes to commit all those files in one commit
git log can be used to vie the log of all the commits done on a repository
git diff can be used to view the differences between two commits
Using version control makes us more confident to make changes that could break the code because you know that you can always revert back to the last working commit
I want  to try using Git for version control of my source code
