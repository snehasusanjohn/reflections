When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
Ans : When you have different developers contributing to your work
Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Ans: There might be commits that you might not want in your version
Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
Ans: Fork is Githubs mechanism for cloning someone else's repository into your account. 
Clone is to make a copy of your repository either locally or from remote to local 
Branch is to make a copy of the master branch of your repository locally
What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
Ans: Beneficial if you want to do a git diff , git log when you have to work offline 
How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?
Ans: Without git and git hub , collaborating would have to be done manually , via email or google docs , drop box etc . Merging would have to be done manually , even the ones without any conflict 
When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master? What benefits does each approach have?
When you are doing experimental work that hasn't been green lit yet , it would be best to do that on a seperate branch inpite of the added work of merging later on . But say you need to fix a small bug immediately , that you know would involve changing very few lines of code . Then working directly on the master would be advantageous to push the changes out into production .
